                 <p>ever since I was young I have always been facinated by technology and how it works.
                    My father works as a software engineer and introduced my to coding from a young age through first robotics.
                    Ever since than I have been pursing more knowlege in the computer science field in my spare time.
                    To date I have built many computers and programs and aquired a computer science degree.
                    This page exists to display current applications and projects that I have actively deployed.
